Playing bullet chess is sometimes a gamble. It's easy to lose a game, and then another, and then I'm down 5 games. Here's an example

![Streak](/losing_streak.png)

I lose 30 points in a matter of minutes, because I don't realize I'm tilting. 

I wanted stop myself from doing that. Once I realized I'm not self-aware enough to stop myself when I'm in the thick of it, an external force was required. 

So I made ChessBreak. It:

*   Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws
*   Notices when you're on a losing streak.
*   If you lose 3 in a row, it blocks you from starting new games for 5 minutes.
*   If I lose over 30 points in a playing session, it blocks me from starting a new game for 10 minutes. 

That's it. Super simple. The idea is just to force you to take a breath, and maybe step away for a bit.

Here's what it does:

*   You install it, and it watches your games on chess.com. No setup.
*   A little popup tells you how you're doing (or not doing).
*   Blocks new games after 3 losses.
*   It's tiny and doesn't hog resources.

To install it:

1.  Download the [thing](https://inkscribe-org/chessbreak).
2.  Go to Chrome extensions and turn on "Developer mode."
3.  "Load unpacked" and point it to the folder.
4.  Go play chess on chess.com.

How it works under the hood is also simple: it watches when games start and end and records whether you won or lost. If you lose three in a row, it removes the buttons from the DOM for  five minutes. After five minutes, it resets the stats.

When you click the extension icon, you'll see your record, your current losing streak, and whether it's currently blocking you. If it is, take a break!

If you lose 3 in a row, the new game buttons go away, and a timer starts counting down. Go get a coffee or something.

## Results

The results were surprisingly effective. I hit my peak (2672) in a week of using the extension:

This is about 100 points over my previous peak I reached over a year ago.

## Future Improvements

I'm thinking about adding a few more things later on, like letting you change how many losses trigger the block, or making it work on Lichess too. And maybe some fancier stats. Let me know if you'd like to see any of these changes, cause I don't play on Lichess often enough to warrant any of these.
