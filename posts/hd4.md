As part of [HackDearborn](https://hackdearborn.org)'s dev team, I've been working on the hackathon's website and app since 2024. Check it out [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hackdearborn.hackdearbornapp&pli=1).  

React Native, and specifically Expo is truly god's gift to earth, because I can't imagine having to juggle Java and design UI with XML.  Instead, I get tailwind autocomplete and program my mobile app like it was yet another website. 

Working on my first, (well technically second, since I also worked on 2024's app) large scale project was loads of fun, and I'm glad we got it to the final stage.
