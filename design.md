Design Specification: "Sentient Core" Aesthetic

This design language mimics a high-fidelity futuristic operating system or military-grade HUD (Heads Up Display). It relies heavily on negative space, monospace typography, and a "dark mode" foundation to make colored data pop.

1. Color Palette

The scheme is high-contrast, using a deep void black background to make the "hot" accent colors glow.

Background (Void): #050505 (Not pure black, but a very deep charcoal for depth).

Primary Accent (Plasma Orange):

Base: #FF4500 (OrangeRed)

Highlight: #FFA500 (Orange)

Used for: The central core, critical alerts, active navigation states.

Status (Cognizant Green): #4ADE80 or #10B981 (Terminal Green). Used strictly for "Success" or "Online" statuses.

Text (HUD White): #F3F4F6 (Cool White) for primary headers.

Text (Dimmed): #6B7280 (Cool Gray) for secondary labels and passive data.

2. Typography

The typography mixes a clean geometric sans-serif for titles with a strict monospace font for data, reinforcing the "machine" aesthetic.

Primary Header Font: Inter or Helvetica Neue (Weights: 300 Light to 500 Medium). Tight letter spacing (-0.02em).

Data/UI Font: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or Roboto Mono. Uppercase styling with wide letter spacing (tracking-widest) to mimic technical schematics.

3. Layout & Grid

Symmetrical Balance: The design is centered around the "Hero" (the sphere).

The "Holy Grail" Layout:

Top Bar: Full-width navigation and system status.

Left Flank: Narrative content (Title, description, status).

Center: Visual focus (3D Element).

Right Flank: Quantifiable metrics (Data points, percentages).

Floating Elements: UI elements should feel like they are floating on a glass layer above the 3D background.

4. Visual Effects (FX)

Bloom/Glow: The central orange element must appear to emit light. This is achieved via high contrast and "Emissive" material properties in 3D rendering.

Wireframes: Surrounding the solid core with a wireframe sphere adds technical depth and implies "structure" or "containment."

Particles: Floating specks in the background simulate dust in a projector beam or data packets, adding life to the static void.

Motion: Nothing is static. The core pulses (breathing effect), numbers tick up/down, and rings rotate.

5. UI Elements

Micro-borders: Very thin (1px), subtle borders on buttons and containers, often with low opacity (10-20%).

Breadcrumbs: "INTERFACE > NEURAL_NET" suggests a deep file structure.

Status Indicators: Small colored dots (LEDs) next to text.
