          <p>
            Fool grows older and turns 18 on the 18<sup>th</sup>. Fool grew
            older and now displays many signs of aging, mainly baldness and
            fatness. However he remains firm and maintains that his life has
            just begun which is not true. His life is 25% over. RIP.

          <h3>CFO receives promotion</h3>
          <p>
            TheShyamShop<sup>tm</sup>'s very own CFO received a promotion to
            recognise him for his long hours of work. His job title is now
            "Master of organisational Bankruptsy(MOOB)". He will discharge his
            duties as CFO along with his new responsibilities for an increased
            compensation of $0.53. His total compensation now stands at $3,
            putting him above the poverty line. On an unrelated note, mob
            violence increased as one of Shyamcorp's glove factories were
            completely destroyed.

          <h3>Shyamcorp Protests</h3>
          <p>
            Shyamcorp workers began protesting on Thursday as rumours of a pay
            raise for the already well paid top executives of the company. They
            cite "lack of educational qualifications" and "Stupidity" as one of
            the top reasons as to why this pay raise is undeserved. However, we
            don't care because our MOOB is an awesome person.
